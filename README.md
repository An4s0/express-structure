# Express Structure
---
### Overview
Express Structure is a template for building web applications using Node.js, Express, and EJS. It follows a structured folder architecture to separate different concerns such as API handling, configuration, middleware, database connection, routing, views, and static assets.

## Folder Structure
#### api
* user.api.js: Contains code for making API calls related to user operations.

#### configs

* db.config.js: Contains database configuration settings.

#### middlewares
* index.js: Contains middleware code that runs before a request reaches a route handler.

#### models
* connect.js: Contains code for connecting to the database.

#### routes
* Contains route handler files for different endpoints.

#### views
* pages: Contains EJS files for the applicationâ€™s pages.
* partials: Contains reusable chunks of HTML code (EJS partials) that can be included in other EJS files.
